EEZ DIB BP3C is backplane for connecting up to three EEZ DIB peripheral modules. When power modules (e.g. [DCP405](https://github.com/eez-open/modular-psu/tree/master/dcp405)) are plugged into slot #1 and #2, their outputs can be combined under firmware control in one of the following way:

- Serial coupling to double max. output voltage 
- Parallel coupling to double max. output current
- Coupling of all Out- terminals (common GND)
- Ch#1 Out- and Ch#2 Out+ coupling for split rail output
